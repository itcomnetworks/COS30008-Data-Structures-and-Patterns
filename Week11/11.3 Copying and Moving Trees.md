### 11.3 Copying and Moving Trees

Copying and moving trees involve duplicating or transferring ownership of tree nodes. This is important for resource management.

#### Copying Trees

When copying trees, each node must be duplicated to create an independent copy.

#### Example Code for Copying a Tree

```cpp
class BinarySearchTree {
public:
    BinaryTreeNode* root;

    // Copy constructor
    BinarySearchTree(const BinarySearchTree& other) {
        root = copyNodes(other.root);
    }

private:
    BinaryTreeNode* copyNodes(BinaryTreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr) return nullptr;

        BinaryTreeNode* newNode = new BinaryTreeNode(node->data);
        newNode->left = copyNodes(node->left);
        newNode->right = copyNodes(node->right);

        return newNode;
    }
};
```

**Explanation:** This code snippet shows how to implement a copy constructor for a binary search tree. The `copyNodes` function recursively duplicates each node from the original tree.

#### Moving Trees

Moving trees involves transferring ownership of resources without duplicating them, which can enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary copies.

#### Example Code for Moving Trees

```cpp
class BinarySearchTree {
public:
    BinaryTreeNode* root;

    // Move constructor
    BinarySearchTree(BinarySearchTree&& other) noexcept : root(other.root) {
        other.root = nullptr; // Nullify the source's root to prevent double deletion
    }

private:
   // Other methods...
};
```

**Explanation:** This example demonstrates how to implement a move constructor for a binary search tree. The move constructor transfers ownership of the `root` pointer from one instance to another while nullifying the source's pointer to avoid double deletion.
