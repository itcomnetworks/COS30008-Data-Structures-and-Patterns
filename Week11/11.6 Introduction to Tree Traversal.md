### 11.6: Introduction to Tree Traversal

#### Definition of Tree Traversal

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure systematically. It is crucial for performing various operations such as searching, inserting, deleting, and displaying the contents of a tree. 

Traversal methods allow us to access each node in a specific order, which is essential for tasks like evaluating expressions, rendering trees in graphical applications, and searching for values.

#### Importance of Tree Traversal

- **Data Access**: Traversals provide a way to access and manipulate the data stored in trees.
- **Searching**: Efficiently finding a specific value or node within the tree structure.
- **Modification**: Inserting or deleting nodes requires traversing the tree to find the appropriate location.
- **Representation**: Displaying the tree structure in a human-readable format.

### Types of Tree Traversal

There are two primary methods for traversing trees:

1. **Depth-First Traversal (DFT)**: This method explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
   - **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root first, then traverse the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.
   - **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree first, visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.
   - **Postorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree first, then traverse the right subtree, and visit the root last.

2. **Breadth-First Traversal (BFT)**: This method visits all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is typically implemented using a queue.
